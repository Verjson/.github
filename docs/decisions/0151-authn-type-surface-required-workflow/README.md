# 0151 — Bind authn type-surface enforcement to a required workflow

- **Date:** 2026-08-28
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Issue:** [#1154](https://github.com/Verjson/.github/issues/1154)

## Context

`Verjson/verjson-authn` ruleset `21522093` requires a GitHub Actions check named
`type-surface-contract`. That check is authored in the pull request's own workflow, so a
pull request can replace the aggregator with an inert successful job carrying the same
name. App attribution plus a context string does not prove that protected code ran.

The type-surface contract also needs private `@verjson/*` packages and an immutable base
`NEXT/` snapshot. Giving those credentials to pull-request-authored build or contract
steps would repair the provenance defect by reopening a credential-execution defect.

## Decision

Create `.github/workflows/authn-type-surface-required.yml` as an organization-owned
required workflow. It runs only for `pull_request`, refuses every repository except the
numeric-rule-selected `Verjson/verjson-authn`, and calls protected canonical `node-ci.yml`
with `secretless-pr: true`. The acquisition job alone receives the consumer-scoped
`GITHUB_TOKEN` with contents, packages, and statuses read permissions. The reusable
workflow call is pinned to the reviewed immutable `c973a841` revision. The canonical
lane transfers only lock- and policy-bound package bytes and the exact auxiliary source;
checkout, install, build, and `test:type-surface-compatibility` execute credentiallessly
on the fixed ephemeral hosted lane established by ADR 0147.

Create a dedicated active organization branch ruleset named
`authn-type-surface-required-workflow`. Its scope is the exact immutable repository ID
`1302124584` and `~DEFAULT_BRANCH`; it has no bypass actors. Its sole rule selects the
canonical repository ID `1269388380`, exact workflow path, `refs/heads/main`, and the
merged canonical SHA supplied at rollout. A repository-local workflow or check bearing
the same display name has neither the required-workflow URL nor the protected path and
cannot satisfy this rule.

The organization-wide ruleset conformance audit normally requires the release App's
bypass on every default-branch-token ruleset. Its policy now carries one narrow exception
for this exact ruleset. The exception matches the ruleset name, numeric consumer scope,
canonical workflow repository/path/ref, immutable 40-hex SHA, disabled-on-create flag,
active enforcement, and empty bypass list; any widened or malformed variant remains a
conformance failure. This is an explicit no-bypass decision, not a generic exemption.

The checked-in rollout tool is read-only by default. Apply is allowed only after its
workflow, contract, and tool bytes are present at a SHA reachable from protected `main`,
the consumer identity and repository-ruleset preimage still match, and the explicit
human acknowledgement is supplied. It first creates the organization rule disabled,
reads back its exact scope, path, SHA, and empty bypass set, then activates it and requires
exact equality again. It does not remove repository ruleset `21522093`.

After creation, use the tool's `snapshot` mode immediately before triggering a fresh
authn pull-request run, then verify it with the checked-in tool. The accepted receipt must
have an ID greater than the pre-trigger maximum and a creation time after the live
ruleset's activation timestamp, be completed/success, use event `pull_request`, bind the
exact candidate head, carry the canonical path, and use the consumer-scoped
`actions/required_workflows/<positive-id>` URL while the live organization rule retains
the exact workflow SHA. Only then may the authn-owned follow-up update its ADR and remove
ruleset `21522093`. A failure preserves both enforcement mechanisms and stops rollout.

## Consequences

- Pull-request-authored names and workflow rewrites no longer establish type-surface
  provenance.
- Private acquisition stays in protected code and PR-authored execution remains
  credentialless on disposable hosted capacity.
- The policy affects only `Verjson/verjson-authn`; no property assignment or name pattern
  can broaden it implicitly.
- Rollout is intentionally two-phase: merge protected bytes first, then apply and verify
  the organization rule under a human gate, then hand off consumer-owned retirement.
