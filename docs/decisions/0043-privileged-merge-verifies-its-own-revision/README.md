# 0043 — Privileged merge verifies which revision of itself is executing

- **Date:** 2026-08-01
- **Issue:** [Verjson/.github#278](https://github.com/Verjson/.github/issues/278)
- **Extends:** [ADR 0042](../0042-privileged-merge-reusable-split/README.md) (the `@main` pin),
  [ADR 0039](../0039-required-workflow-gate-provenance/README.md) (gate provenance)
- **Category:** merge authority / org admin token — **sensitive class**

## Context

ADR 0042 requires a consumer's thin caller to pin `@main` rather than a SHA, arguing that a
SHA-pinned caller would let a repository admin freeze an older privileged merge while the
trust anchor moved on. **Nothing enforced that**, and the ADR recorded the exposure as
closed — which is the more serious half of the defect.

The two mechanisms it named both run *here*:
`scripts/gen-privileged-merge-caller.sh` generates the caller and
`scripts/node-workflow-pins.test.sh` asserts the pin's form. The caller file lives in the
**consumer's** repository. Neither binds anything downstream, so a consumer admin could
re-pin to a pre-ADR-0039 revision and reinstate a weaker merge path.

The existing runtime anchor does not catch it either: `trusted_workflow_sha` pins the
**gate**'s revision inside `trusted_run_def`, not `ai-privileged-merge.yml`'s own. Every
other guard could pass while this workflow was itself executing from a fork.

## Decision

The privileged merge resolves the revision of **itself** that is executing and requires it
to be on `Verjson/.github@main`, before any write and before the merge. (Two read-only
`gh api` calls establishing the trust anchor precede it; nothing that changes state does.)

The revision comes from `job.workflow_sha` / `job.workflow_repository` — the workflow
identity of the job's *defining* workflow, which is what a reusable call carries — falling
back to `github.workflow_sha` and `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` for `.github`'s own
`pull_request_target` run, where the job is not reusable-defined.

**Those two must be declared on the step, not on the job.** The `job` context is
unavailable in a job-level `env:` (allowed there: `github`, `inputs`, `matrix`, `needs`,
`secrets`, `strategy`, `vars`). Placed at job level they resolve **empty**, the fallbacks
then describe the *caller* rather than this file, and the result is the worst available
outcome: every consumer fails the identity check while `.github`'s own run stays green,
because there `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` happens to match. This shipped that way and was caught by
actionlint in review, not by the unit tests — which inject the variables directly and so
cannot see the wiring at all. Recorded here because it is invisible from the shell script
and silent in exactly the direction that looks like success.

Neither spelling is trusted to be present: an absent or non-40-hex value is a hard failure
naming that cause, not a `set -u` abort somewhere downstream.

Acceptance is **reachability from `main`**, not equality:

| Comparison | Outcome |
|---|---|
| equal to `main`'s tip | accepted, no API call |
| `identical` / `ahead` with `behind_by == 0` | accepted, **with a warning** |
| `behind`, `diverged`, or any `behind_by > 0` | rejected |
| comparison unreadable, or missing `.status` | rejected |
| executing repository is not `Verjson/.github` | rejected |

Equality alone cannot be required: `main` may legitimately advance between the caller's
dispatch and this step, and a strict check would turn every such race into a red merge
check on a correctly merged pull request — the failure mode ADR 0042's concurrency section
already had to unwind once.

`behind_by` is checked alongside `status` because `ahead` on its own also describes a
diverged history that merely shares an ancestor.

## What this does NOT close

Stated plainly, because recording an exposure as closed when it is not is exactly the
defect this ADR exists to correct.

**A caller pinned to an older commit that is still on `main` passes.** It is reachable, so
it is accepted. Distinguishing a deliberate stale pin from the benign advance-mid-flight
race needs dispatch-time state this job does not have, so the two are indistinguishable
here and the run emits a `::warning::` naming both readings rather than choosing one.

What is now closed is narrower than "a fork cannot reach the token", and the distinction
matters. `ORG_ADMIN_TOKEN` is supplied **by the caller** through `workflow_call.secrets`, so
a consumer admin who points `uses:` at a fork of this file *with the check deleted* reaches
the token exactly as before. A workflow can only bind its own behaviour.

What this closes is **replay of a genuine revision**: an unmodified copy of this workflow —
which is what a caller pinning `Verjson/.github` gets — refuses to act when it is running
from a side branch, a rewritten history, or any revision never on `main`. The
fork-with-the-check-removed path is a *secret distribution* problem, not a workflow-content
one, and its residual is [#265](https://github.com/Verjson/.github/issues/265): the org
Actions secrets sit at `visibility: all`.

The residual is bounded by how far `main` can be behind itself, and is visible in the run
log every time it occurs. Narrowing it further — for example by binding the caller's
resolved ref at dispatch — belongs with #276's runtime self-derivation work, which touches
the same wait loop.

## Consequences

- Every consumer's privileged merge now makes one additional API call on the non-equal
  path only. The equality path, which is the normal case, costs nothing.
- A consumer that re-pins to a SHA off `main` breaks **loudly and immediately**, with a
  message naming ADR 0042, instead of silently running an older trust boundary.
- `scripts/ci-gate/privileged-merge-pin.test.sh` pins the behaviour; the existing
  privileged-merge suites now supply the workflow identity, so a future change that drops
  the check fails eleven assertions rather than one.

## Rollback

Revert the implementing PR. The check is self-contained and additive: nothing else reads
`executing_workflow_sha`, and removing it returns the workflow to trusting whatever ref a
caller pinned. No consumer migration is involved either way, because the caller side is
unchanged — this is entirely a runtime assertion on the callee.
