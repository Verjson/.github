# Protected runner deployment operations

The deployment contract is a separately dispatched transition from an immutable
release manifest to an existing DigitalOcean runner fleet. It never builds an image,
creates capacity, resizes a Droplet, or accepts a tag. Live adoption and fleet-specific
values belong in the consumer repository; this repository stores no deployment token.

## Generate the adopter contract

Acquire `scripts/gen-container-deployment.sh` from one reviewed 40-character
`Verjson/.github` commit and generate all five artifacts at that same commit:

```sh
scripts/gen-container-deployment.sh workflow <contract-sha> container-deployment.json > .github/workflows/container-deployment.yml
scripts/gen-container-deployment.sh controller <contract-sha> > scripts/container_deployment_controller.py
scripts/gen-container-deployment.sh preflight <contract-sha> > scripts/container_deployment_preflight.py
scripts/gen-container-deployment.sh receipt-schema <contract-sha> > scripts/deployment-receipt.schema.json
scripts/gen-container-deployment.sh contract-test <contract-sha> container-deployment.json > scripts/container-deployment-contract.test.sh
```

Commit a reviewed `container-deployment.json`. Its fleet selector fixes the existing
lane, project, ordinary canary, deterministic runner inventory, minimum available
capacity, time bounds, runner group, labels, tools, and consumer-owned evidence/probe
scripts. The local CLI selector is exactly `verjson-cloud`; the controller resolves it
only from the immutable acquisition root supplied by the reusable workflow. Run the
generated contract test in CI.

The reusable workflow acquires `@verjson/cli-cloud` from the immutable contract
checkout using the contract's committed npm lockfile. GitHub Packages receives only
the job token with `packages: read`; `npm ci --ignore-scripts` verifies the locked
SHA-512 dependency graph and canonical npm/GitHub Packages URLs before the local CLI
is admitted. The exact Node runtime and setup action are pinned. Each job uses a unique
cache under `RUNNER_TEMP`; an always-run final step removes that cache, the contract
archive, and the extracted dependency tree. The consumer must not install, cache, or
select another deployment CLI.

Configure the consumer's `production` environment to admit protected branches only.
It is a credential and audit boundary, not a human approval gate: no environment
reviewer is required and administrator bypass may remain enabled. Store the
project-scoped `DIGITALOCEAN_RUNNER_FLEET_TOKEN` and
`GH_RUNNER_REGISTRATION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` only there. Configure
`GH_RUNNER_REGISTRATION_APP_CLIENT_ID` and
`GH_RUNNER_REGISTRATION_APP_INSTALLATION_ID` as repository or environment variables.
Install `org-gh-runner-registration` on selected repositories only, with organization
self-hosted runners read/write. Review those settings
and credential scope as sensitive changes; never print their values.

Commit stable numeric App and installation IDs, check names, and workflow paths under consumer
`container-deployment.json` `reviewAuthority` object. These reviewed-tree values are the
only trust roots; Actions variables cannot redirect them. Generate code, security, AI
adapter, shared trusted publisher, and helper with `gen-container-deployment.sh` modes
`code-review-workflow`, `security-review-workflow`, `ai-review-workflow`,
`review-producer-workflow`, and `review-producer` at the same immutable contract SHA.
The three App IDs and installation targets must differ. In every caller repository,
store each private key only in its matching
`runner-deploy-{code,security,ai}-review-publisher` protected environment. Reusable
workflow environments and secrets belong to `github.repository` (the caller), while the
serialized `job.workflow_repository/ref/sha` fields identify the called reusable workflow.
Generated adapters pin the reusable producer to the exact contract SHA. Analysis has no
publisher credential. An uncredentialed prerequisite verifies the live caller-owned
environment and exact default ref before the environment job can start. GitHub releases
environment secrets when that job starts; an in-job check cannot gate initial release.
The credentialed job therefore relies on GitHub's native protected-branch environment
admission, then rechecks the content-addressed policy for TOCTOU/audit and validates
the parsed `job.workflow_repository/ref/sha` before loading code or minting a token.
Because actionlint 1.7.7's static `job` schema predates those GitHub fields, the workflow
passes only `toJSON(job)` to a nonsecret step, validates the three fields with `jq`, and
exposes bounded outputs. It checks out the validated canonical repository at the
validated called-workflow SHA. Caller `github.workflow_*` and inputs cannot select
producer code. The PR and consumer config remain API data. The
environment-policy digest is SHA-256 over the sorted compact JSON projection
`{id,name,deployment_branch_policy,protection_rules}` with no trailing newline; shell
producers use `jq -j -cS` and deployment uses the same canonical-byte helper. The
machine-readable claim binds repository ID, PR exact
head/tree/diff, immutable producer commit/tree, installation ID, workflow run/attempt.
The AI adapter references a pinned App-owned terminal-green source check on that head.
Dispatch producers from the merged default-branch commit, never a PR ref. They reconcile
the prior unprivileged exact-PR-head reviews into App checks on that deployed commit.
Deployment resolves exactly one associated PR and requires its reviewed
tree to equal the checked-out default-branch tree byte-for-byte. Merge, squash, and
rebase commit IDs may differ; conflict-resolution or unrelated-tree drift fails closed.
The canonical workflow re-fetches the checks, workflow runs, artifacts, actors,
environment policy, and bypass basis through GitHub before admitting mutation.
The environment has exactly GitHub's `branch_policy` protection rule, including its live
ID/node metadata, and no reviewer, timer, or custom rule. This makes
`environmentBypassed: false` observable while administrator bypass remains available.

## Dry-run and deployment

Dispatch with `dry-run: true` first. The unprotected dry-run resolves the immutable
manifest and uploads the exact redacted canary-first host plan without receiving a deployment
credential or mutating an external system. Reject any plan with an unexpected host,
baseline, signer, source ref, release-contract pin, label/tool requirement, or capacity
floor.

The manifest identity is the bare `sha256:<64 lowercase hex>` digest of the canonical
`release-manifest.json` GitHub Release asset. A registry-qualified reference, image
digest, or tag is not a release identity and is rejected before evidence collection.

Dispatch the same manifest digest and fleet selector with `dry-run: false`. The job waits
at `production`, re-collects current evidence, restores and validates any retained
append-only chain for the exact run attempt, head, manifest, and plan, or retains a new
revision `0000` before the first mutation. It then calls
`verjson-cloud runner update --only <host>` one host at a time. The
canary's exact routed probe and observation window must pass before a second host starts.
Every later revision binds the canonical digest of its predecessor. A post-update
revision is retained before probing, and each bounded host phase uploads progress. Fleet
timing must leave at least 15 minutes of the 90-minute job unused.

The canary receipt records observation as `pending` after its probe passes and records a
second revision as `passed` only after the full window returns. Cancellation while the
window is pending repeats the bounded observation on resume; it cannot make a later host
eligible.

## Pause, resume, and interruption

Do not cancel a healthy update merely because the observation window is quiet. To pause
before dispatch, retain the dry-run plan and do not approve `production`. Once mutation
has started, a failed drain, admission check, probe, timeout, or operator cancellation
stops the state machine; it never skips to another host.

An interrupted run retains at least its admitted revision. Seal an `interrupted` revision
from that exact attempt before recovery. The evidence adapter must retrieve the complete
contiguous revision chain, exact retained plan, and keyed
`<attempt>/<artifact>@sha256:<artifact-digest>` authority over both.
Resume only when the current fleet agrees with every retained final-fleet entry and the
attempt, checked-out head, manifest, and canonical plan digest are unchanged. The
controller skips only transitions whose update and routed probe are both verified. An
unknown post-mutation state fails closed until live evidence seals it; never restart from
a guessed host or mutable tag.

The protected workflow runs the controller's `reconcile` command after restoring a
retained chain. For each unknown host, the evidence adapter must report its immutable
manifest identity, release, and deployed image digest. Exact selected-release evidence
seals a `reconciled` transition and resumes at probe/observation without another drain;
exact attempt-baseline evidence removes the uncertain transition and permits a new
bounded update only when `releaseManifest` canonical bytes match the recorded baseline
manifest identity and its reviewed variant index digest exactly matches the live deployed
digest. A missing baseline manifest, any other release, inconsistent manifest, or absent
or unrelated digest stops with an operator-safe error. Preserve the chain and quarantine
the host until evidence is repaired or an independently approved rollback is dispatched.

## Rollback

Rollback is a new, independently approved `production` dispatch with `action: rollback`.
Select the exact manifest identity recorded as `observedDeployedRelease` on the failed or
interrupted attempt and supply that attempt's retained canonical receipt digest. The
consumer evidence adapter retrieves the retained receipt by that identity; it is never a
dispatcher-controlled filesystem path. The controller rejects a
predecessor from another attempt, a changed baseline, or a receipt-digest mismatch. The
same canary, sequential capacity floor, probes, and admission checks apply. If the exact
baseline manifest or evidence is unavailable, stop and escalate; do not rebuild or use a
tag as recovery authority.

## Credential rotation and incidents

Rotate `DIGITALOCEAN_RUNNER_FLEET_TOKEN` and the `org-gh-runner-registration` App
private key in the consumer environment without editing callers
or generated files. Confirm the replacement retains only the named existing-fleet update,
runner admission, and evidence permissions; it must not authorize capacity creation or
unrelated environments. Revoke the old credential after a mutation-free dry-run and a
reviewed environment audit.

For signer, digest, fleet-baseline, transaction-lock, capacity, or rollback-verification
failures, preserve all receipt artifacts and the workflow URL, quarantine the affected
runner from scheduling, and escalate to the runner-fleet owner and security owner. Do not
retry until the retained receipt and live state explain every host. Never include secret
or organization-variable values in an incident record.
