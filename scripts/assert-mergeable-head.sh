# which ADR 0178 made ambiguous in the one direction that matters. That form
# answers a single question — "is anything red?" — so a deferred head, a head
# missing a required check entirely, and a head with a genuinely failing
# advisory check all collapse into one bare `false`. The predictable field fix
# for an opaque `false` is to widen the accepted-conclusion list, which is
# precisely how `Verjson/verjson-cli#251`'s unexercised-head class returns.
#
# This script answers three separable questions and names which one failed, so
# that relaxing any of them is a deliberate, reviewable act rather than an
# allowlist edit made under time pressure:
#
#   Gate A  every REQUIRED context for the base ref exists on the head, was
#           produced by the app the ruleset binds it to, has completed, and
#           passed. An absent required check fails closed (ADR 0024) instead of
#           being silently satisfied by its own absence.
#   Gate B  positive evidence that verification actually executed: the head
#           carries no ADR 0178 `deferred-ci` check that ran, and no ADR 0156
#           deferral annotation. This is the gate a deferred Renovate head
#           fails, and it says so in those words.
#   Gate C  no other check on the head is pending or non-passing.
#
# Prints "true" and exits 0 only when all three hold. Every other outcome is a
# fault: a `::error::` naming the gate, and a distinct exit code — never a bare
# "false", and never a zero exit on an unanswered question.
#
# PERMISSIONS. The script reads pull-request metadata, check runs, commit statuses,
# and `repos/{owner}/{repo}/rules/branches/{base}`; the last is Gate A's ONLY source
# of the required set. A caller missing any read cannot evaluate the assertion, and
# this script refuses rather than falling back to partial data. `administration` is
# NOT required, and an organization-level ruleset is returned through this repository
# endpoint without organization read, verified against
# `repos/Verjson/.github/rules/branches/main`, which returns its org-sourced
# `required_status_checks` rule to a wholly unauthenticated caller.
#
# The complete grant per token type is stated in `permission_help()` below and quoted
# into access-related failures. Each endpoint also names its specific fine-grained and
# Actions grant so an early refusal is actionable. An authorization refusal (401/403, or the 404
# GitHub substitutes when it masks an unauthorized read of a private repository)
# exits 1 with a message naming the token as the cause and quoting that help; it is
# never a silent pass and never an undifferentiated API error.
#
# An adopter lacking that read therefore fails CLOSED with a message naming the token as
# the cause -- it is never handed a degraded or empty required set. That matters because
# the converse was once assumed: that a token able to read the repository but not the
# organization's rulesets would receive a 200 carrying an empty rule list, and so be
# misreported as an ungoverned ref. It does not. Verified against the live endpoint
# (2026-09-18): `repos/Verjson/.github/rules/branches/main` returns its organization-sourced
# rules in full, `ruleset_source_type: Organization` included, to a WHOLLY UNAUTHENTICATED
# caller; a caller without repository read is refused 401/403/404 instead. Read access to
# the repository is the whole requirement, and an unreadable ruleset is not a cause of an
# empty list. What does produce a 200 with an empty list is an ungoverned ref OR a ref that
# does not exist under the path requested -- also verified: a nonexistent branch answers
# 200 `[]` exactly as an ungoverned one does. Gate A names that ambiguity outright rather
# than asserting either cause, because the two remedies are opposite (#1437).
#
#   2  usage error
#   3  Gate A failed (required contexts absent, misattributed, pending, or not passing)
#   4  Gate B failed (the head was deferred; nothing on it was verified)
#   5  Gate C failed (some other check is pending or non-passing)
#   1  the assertion could not be evaluated (API failure, unresolvable state)
#
# There is deliberately NO environment override for any gate's matching rule.
# An earlier draft exposed the deferral patterns as tunable variables, which
# made disabling Gate B a one-variable edit — cheaper than the allowlist
# widening this script exists to prevent, and invisible in the output. A gate
# whose strictness is configurable at the call site is not a gate.
# `-e` is deliberately absent: the advisory-check loop below ends on a test that
# is legitimately false, which would abort under `-e`. Correctness therefore
# rests on every command substitution carrying its own `|| fault` — do not add
# an unguarded `$(...)` here.
