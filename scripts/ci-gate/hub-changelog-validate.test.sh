# `impact:` merged green on #1418 for exactly that reason, and the snapshot it
# would have been consumed into is immutable.

# The remedy is that the producer exercises its own contract at the source
# rather than adopting its own consumer packaging: this wrapper runs
# `scripts/changelog.py validate --base <base> --head HEAD` from the hub's own
# `platform` CI group. These assertions are what keep that wrapper honest.
