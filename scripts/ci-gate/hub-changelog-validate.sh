# Run the changelog contract this repository publishes against this repository's
# own pull request (Verjson/.github#1425).
#
# The hub carries `verjson-stack=actions` and `verjson-core-checks=enforced`, so
# it is in the `core-checks-actions` ruleset cohort and NOT in
# `changelog-contract-required`: the `changelog / validate` required check that
# ~90 adopters run never ran here. #1418 merged a fragment with no `impact:`
# because of that, and the `CHANGELOG/<version>.md` snapshot it would have been
# consumed into is immutable.
#
# The hub is the contract's producer, so it exercises the contract at its SOURCE
# — `scripts/changelog.py` from this checkout — rather than adopting its own
# consumer packaging. That is deliberate: a cohort property is a claim about a
# repository's stack, and this keeps working if those properties are
# reorganized.
#
# `check-pr` is a different, narrower gate and is not a substitute: it covers the
# dependency-manifest/fragment pairing and exits 0 both for a missing `impact:`
# and for a duplicate fragment identity. Only `validate --base` sees either.
