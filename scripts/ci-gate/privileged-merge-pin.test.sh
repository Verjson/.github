# ADR 0042 requires a consumer's thin caller to pin `@main`, and until #278
# nothing enforced it. The caller file lives in the CONSUMER's repository, so
# `scripts/gen-privileged-merge-caller.sh` and `scripts/node-workflow-pins.test.sh`
# — both of which run here — bind nothing downstream. The existing runtime anchor
# pins the GATE's revision (`trusted_workflow_sha`), not this workflow's own, so
# ai-privileged-merge.yml could itself be executing from a fork or a stale ref
# with every other check passing.
#
# The step's `run:` block is extracted from the shipped workflow (single source
# of truth) and exercised against a stubbed `gh`, per house convention.
#
# Every negative case asserts the SPECIFIC terminal error, so a harness
# regression cannot make a case pass by failing somewhere else — the failure
# mode that let a fail-open guard ship green before.
