# Least-privilege topology of ai-review-merge.yml, and the hardening of the one
# job that holds `actions: write` on the PR-facing side (Verjson/.github#1320).
#
# The original harness pinned the pre-ADR-0079 four-job shape with global
# `grep -c` counts and drove the retired "Dispatch fixed trusted merge
# continuation" step, whose merge-probe/postcondition loop ADR 0081 replaced with
# event-driven retries. Counts could not survive the `complete-authorization` job
# that ADR 0079 added, so the whole file went stale at once and was deregistered.
#
# Counts are the wrong assertion anyway: they say "one job has actions: write"
# without saying WHICH, so moving the grant to another job keeps them green. The
# map below is exact and per job, so a new job or a widened grant has to be
# stated here to land. That is the point — this is the sensitive merge-gate
# class, where a silent permission widening is the failure being guarded.
#
# House method: parse the shipped workflow and exercise the named step's real
# `run:` block against a stubbed `gh`, so the test cannot drift from the shipped
# logic. Plain bash + python3 + jq.
