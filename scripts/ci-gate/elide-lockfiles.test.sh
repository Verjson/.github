# Pins the lockfile-elision logic in ai-review-merge.yml's "Prepare bounded
# review context" step (Verjson/.github#110). A generated lockfile in the diff
# (e.g. an 8k-line package-lock) once consumed the whole AI review budget and
# forced a no-verdict, fail-closed run on an otherwise-small PR. The gate now
# filters lockfile hunks out of the payload it hands the model while keeping the
# full diff on disk. This extracts the real filter (LOCK_RE + the two awk
# programs) from the workflow — single source of truth, no drift — and drives it
# against synthetic diffs. Plain bash + awk.
