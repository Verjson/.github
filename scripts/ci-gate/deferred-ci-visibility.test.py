"""A deferred org CI run must not look like an executed, passing run.

`build-test` reports `if: always()` so a Renovate PR held on
`renovate/stability-days` never wedges on a permanently unsatisfied required
context (Verjson/.github#191). The cost is that a deferred run skips every
execution step and still concludes `success` on the required `ci / build-test`
context. `Verjson/verjson-cli#251` is the harm: a repository-local lockfile
guard never ran and a deliberate version hold was violated behind a green
required check.

ADR 0178 keeps the required context satisfying and adds a separate `deferred-ci`
job that exists only on a defer and terminates unsuccessfully, so the deferral is
a first-class non-SUCCESS entry in `statusCheckRollup` rather than an annotation
only an opt-in script reads. These tests pin both halves: the required context
still reports, and the deferral is distinguishable by check conclusion alone.
