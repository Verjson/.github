# Contract check: the pin the migration guide tells consumers to generate against
# must exist in this repository and must contain the generator (Verjson/.github#308).
#
# Consumers were told to pin 1486d44…, which predates gen-changelog-caller.sh. So
# `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../<pin>/scripts/gen-changelog-caller.sh` 404s, and
# an adopter wanting a hermetic contract test had to carry a second ref pointing
# somewhere else — which is two pins for one contract, and the drift #304 was
# filed about wearing a different hat.
#
# This is the #287 lesson applied to the pin instead of to a tag: a documented
# literal that nothing checks will eventually name something that does not exist.
#
# Test seam: CONTRACT_PIN_ROOT selects the repository to check.
