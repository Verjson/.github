# Contract check: every file a repository-wide scanner reads must be matched by
# an `actions-ci` path trigger (Verjson/.github#305).
#
# `doc-tag-pins.sh` reads every tracked file and `doc-fragment-names.sh` every
# tracked `*.md`, but the trigger is an enumeration. A surface a scanner reads
# and the trigger omits produces the worst failure shape available: the PR that
# introduces the bad example passes, and the next unrelated PR to touch a
# triggering path fails instead — pointing at the wrong change and the wrong
# author. Widening the trigger once fixes today; asserting the two agree is what
# stops them drifting apart again.

# is how this assertion goes quietly wrong: my first version anchored on `uses:`
# at line start, while the scanner matches a tag-shaped pin anywhere in any
# tracked file — so a pin in a comment (or in prose) was invisible to the check
# that exists to find exactly that. If the scanner's pattern changes, this fails
