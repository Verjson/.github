# Generate a consumer's thin `ai-privileged-merge.yml` caller.
#
# Generated, not hand-written, because several details fail SILENTLY when wrong:
# the job key, the `uses:` target, and the values passed in `with:`. The
# reasoning lives in docs/decisions/0042-privileged-merge-reusable-split.
#
# Usage:
#   gen-privileged-merge-caller.sh <40-hex-contract-sha> '<required-checks-json>' ['<runner-labels-json>']
#   gen-privileged-merge-caller.sh <40-hex-contract-sha> --retry '<workflow-names-json>' '<required-checks-json>'
#   scripts/gen-privileged-merge-caller.sh <contract-sha> "$required_checks" > .github/workflows/ai-privileged-merge.yml
#
# The runner-label argument is OPTIONAL and should be omitted by every Verjson consumer
# (#405). It used to be mandatory, which meant the generator hardcoded
# `["self-hosted","general"]` into ~90 repositories: a fleet relabel then needed
# a pull request in each of them, which is precisely the coupling the
# `CI_LANE_*` variables exist to remove (ADR 0041). The canonical
# workflow's `runs-on` already resolves without it, ending at a hosted runner for
# an org with no lane variables at all (ADR 0040).
#
# It is kept, not deleted, for the one caller the lane variables cannot serve: a
# self-hosted consumer OUTSIDE Verjson, whose org has no lane variables and whose
# runners answer to labels only it knows.
