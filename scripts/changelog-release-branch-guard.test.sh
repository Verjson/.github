# The check used to be a job-level `if:`, which is the wrong instrument: GitHub
# reports a skipped job as successful to its caller, so dispatching from any
# other ref produced a green run that released nothing. A reusable workflow can
# only fail its caller by running and exiting non-zero, so the properties worth
# pinning are that the check is a step, that it is the *first* step — before the
# checkout that would otherwise act on the wrong assumption — and that it really
# rejects a non-default ref rather than merely mentioning one.

# Being on the default branch is not the same as being on the commit the caller
# verified. Resolving the checkout by branch *name* re-reads the branch head at
# snapshot time, which is a different commit whenever anything merged since the
# dispatch — and a caller's verify job can hold the gap open for its whole
# timeout, or the `changelog-release-${{ github.repository }}` concurrency group
# (cancel-in-progress: false) can hold it open behind another release. The
# window is not theoretical: it releases and publishes a tree nothing checked.
#
# github.sha is the caller's dispatch commit, and the guard above has already
# proved that commit is the default branch head. Pinning it makes the final
# `git push --atomic` non-fast-forward when main has moved, so a concurrent
# merge fails the release with no tag pushed instead of tagging unverified
# content (#463, #464, ADR 0062).
